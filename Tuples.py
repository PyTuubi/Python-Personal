t = (1,2,3)

# len() same as lists
# can have different data types in one tuple i.e. t = (1,"two",3.0)
# slicing and indexing is same

t2 = ("a","a","b")

#print(t2.count("a")) # how many times something is mentioned
#print(t2.index("a")) # first time a certian thing appears

# cant reassign stuff u know yes yes
